Hi there! If you want to help QA test my game on your phone, play [Bumpers](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JuAWJbCU7623lly4gkYvSYCr8eJtdZgJ/view?usp=sharing)
Feel free to leave comments on [My channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW0bffwQ2Pw) how I can make the gameplay better 
I will update my documentation accordingly
